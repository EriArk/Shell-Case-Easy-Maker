# ROADMAP.md

This is the working roadmap for safe 1-2 day implementation chunks.

Each chunk should end with:
- local validation,
- updated `releases/latest/windows` bundle when the app changed,
- updated `WORKLOG.md`,
- commit and push to `origin/main`.

Manual Windows build to open:

```text
C:\Users\EriArk\Documents\CaseMaker\releases\latest\windows\shell_case_easy_maker.exe
```

The release folder is local-only and ignored by Git. Keep the whole folder together; the `.exe` needs the adjacent Flutter runtime files and `data/` folder.

## Chunk Status

- [x] R0 — Roadmap + Latest EXE
- [x] M1 — Semantic Core
- [x] M2 — Commands + Undo
- [ ] M3 — Usable Shell
- [ ] M4 — Viewport MVP
- [ ] M5 — First Geometry Slice

---

## R0 — Roadmap + Latest EXE

### Goal
Make project progress inspectable and make the latest Windows app easy to launch by hand.

### Tasks
- [x] Create `ROADMAP.md`.
- [x] Add `tools/build_latest_windows.ps1`.
- [x] Ignore generated local releases.
- [x] Document latest Windows app path.
- [x] Record the workflow in `WORKLOG.md`.

### Done Criteria
- `ROADMAP.md` defines the next safe chunks.
- `tools/build_latest_windows.ps1` creates `releases/latest/windows`.
- `releases/latest/windows/shell_case_easy_maker.exe` exists after the script runs.
- Generated release files do not appear in Git status.

### Tests
- `flutter pub get`
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`
- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test`
- `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build_latest_windows.ps1`
- `git diff --check`

### Poke Checklist
- Open `releases/latest/windows/shell_case_easy_maker.exe`.
- Confirm the app launches without a console-only failure.
- Confirm the shell shows the top toolbar, left icon rail, viewport, inspector, and bottom status bar.

## M1 — Semantic Core

### Goal
Make the editable project model typed, versioned, and ready for feature/component generators.

### Tasks
- [x] Split semantic model into focused files for project, enclosure, features, feature groups, component templates, and placements.
- [x] Add stable IDs and schema/version handling.
- [x] Add typed JSON serialization/deserialization for all M1 models.
- [x] Add project migration entrypoint, even if only version 1 exists.
- [x] Add unit tests for round-trips and malformed/minimal JSON defaults.

### Done Criteria
- The app still starts with the sample semantic project.
- Models do not store generated mesh, STL, or OCCT topology as editable state.
- Serialization tests cover the default sample project and at least one component template.

### Tests
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`
- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test`
- `tools/build_latest_windows.ps1` if runtime behavior changed

### Poke Checklist
- Launch latest Windows app.
- Confirm the inspector still shows enclosure dimensions and feature/component counts.

## M2 — Commands + Undo

### Goal
Create the command and undo foundations needed for safe semantic editing.

### Tasks
- [x] Implement a command registry with stable command IDs, labels, icons, scopes, and availability checks.
- [x] Add command context for active selection, active surface, and advanced mode.
- [x] Add undo/redo transaction model.
- [x] Add continuous transaction grouping skeleton for future knob/drag edits.
- [x] Add tests for availability and undo/redo behavior.

### Done Criteria
- Commands are metadata-driven, not hard-coded only in widgets.
- Advanced commands are hidden unless advanced mode is enabled.
- Undo/redo tests prove semantic state can move backward and forward.

### Tests
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`
- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test`

### Poke Checklist
- Launch latest Windows app.
- Confirm toolbar buttons remain visible and do not overflow at the default window size.

---

## M3 — Usable Shell

### Goal
Make the current shell useful enough for manual exploration of semantic project state.

### Tasks
- [ ] Add selection model.
- [ ] Connect selected object/surface to the contextual inspector.
- [ ] Add basic project JSON save/load service.
- [ ] Add object summary/tree or compact project browser.
- [ ] Add widget tests for inspector context changes.

### Done Criteria
- Selecting semantic objects changes inspector content.
- Save/load preserves the semantic project model.
- UI stays viewport-first and avoids large permanent text panels.

### Tests
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`
- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test`
- `tools/build_latest_windows.ps1`

### Poke Checklist
- Launch latest Windows app.
- Click/select available semantic items.
- Confirm inspector and status hint update clearly.

## M4 — Viewport MVP

### Goal
Research and implement the first interactive viewport behavior without coupling Flutter to OCCT internals.

### Tasks
- [ ] Research Flutter desktop viewport options and record findings.
- [ ] Choose the first viewer approach for mock/preview geometry.
- [ ] Add orbit/pan/zoom interaction model.
- [ ] Add selection highlight and ghost preview state.
- [ ] Add tests for viewport controller state where practical.

### Done Criteria
- Viewport interaction is separated from geometry generation.
- Selection uses semantic surface/object IDs, not triangle IDs.
- Research note records license and maintenance considerations.

### Tests
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`
- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test`
- `tools/build_latest_windows.ps1`

### Poke Checklist
- Launch latest Windows app.
- Try orbit/pan/zoom.
- Confirm the viewport remains readable and controls do not overlap.

---

## M5 — First Geometry Slice

### Goal
Start the path toward real generated geometry with a worker protocol and rounded enclosure plan.

### Tasks
- [ ] Research OCCT build/distribution and record findings.
- [ ] Define initial `GeometryService` request/response protocol.
- [ ] Add `occt_worker` directory skeleton.
- [ ] Add deterministic rounded enclosure generation plan and validation expectations.
- [ ] Keep mock backend usable while worker is incomplete.

### Done Criteria
- Flutter still depends on `GeometryService`, not OCCT types.
- Worker protocol consumes semantic requests and returns generated results/warnings.
- No editable project data is stored as generated mesh/B-Rep.

### Tests
- `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`
- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test`
- Worker tests if an executable/test harness exists

### Poke Checklist
- Launch latest Windows app.
- Confirm mock preview still works while worker integration is incomplete.
