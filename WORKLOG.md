## 2026-06-27 — Documentation pack created

### Goal
Create initial documentation package for Codex based on product discussion.

### Changes made
- Added AGENTS.md, TASKS.md, WORKLOG.md.
- Added detailed subsystem docs under `docs/`.
- Added templates and examples.

### Next step
Import docs into repository and start Phase 0 / Phase 1 tasks.

## 2026-06-26 — Repository documentation orientation

### Goal
Study the newly added project documentation and check local/GitHub repository state.

### Read before work
`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `TASKS.md`, `MANIFEST.json`, all `docs/*.md`, examples, and templates.

### Changes made
- `TASKS.md`:
  - Added a Phase 0 task to configure the GitHub `origin` remote and push the initial documentation commit.
- `WORKLOG.md`:
  - Added this orientation entry.

### Tests run
- Not run; this was a documentation/repository orientation pass only.

### Validation
- Confirmed documentation pack contains 42 manifest entries.
- Confirmed local repository has no commits yet.
- Confirmed local repository has no configured `origin` remote.
- Confirmed the GitHub repository page is public but currently empty.

### Known issues
- Issue: local Git repository is not connected to `https://github.com/EriArk/Shell-Case-Easy-Maker`.
  - Severity: Medium.
  - Next action: add `origin`, create the first commit, and push.

### Next step
Bootstrap the Flutter desktop project or publish the documentation pack to GitHub first.

### Notes for future Codex sessions
The core product direction is semantic enclosure/device/accessory generation, not generic CAD. Keep Flutter isolated from OCCT internals through `GeometryService`, keep generated B-Rep/meshes as outputs, and add tests for geometry, serialization, validation, and UI state changes.
